### Project Description
This project is a "Secret Notepad" application built with Python's Tkinter library. It provides a secure notepad interface where users can type and save secret messages. The application features disappearing text and automatic character counting that saves the secret message with password protection to a local path but with a surprise.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt the overwhelming need to save secrets in a way that even you might not remember? Tired of traditional notepads that store secrets far too accessibly? Welcome to the realm of our "Secret Notepad," designed to store secrets in files you’ll likely never locate again! and even if you do, its of no use!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing a notepad with a self-erasing feature that hides your message! This app not only saves your secret file but makes finding it feel like a treasure hunt. Forget traditional security – this is the finest way to manage your secret messages. Even after locating the file location, you have to unlock it with a password. After that the message diplayed in the saved file will make it clear to you, how perfect our safety features are !

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Language used : Python
- Frameworks used : Tkinter (Python’s standard GUI framework)
- Libraries Used : tkinter (for GUI), random (to select fun “encrypted” text), os (for file handling and directory management)
- Tools used : Visual Studio Code (IDE), Git, Github


Here's an updated version with steps for installing the necessary libraries:

### Implementation
For Software:

#### Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can check with:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. Install Tkinter (usually included with Python, but in case it's missing):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # for Linux
   ```
   On Windows, Tkinter should be available by default with Python.

3. Install the `python-docx` library to enable creating and editing `.docx` files:
   ```bash
   pip install python-docx
   ```

4. Install the `pywin32` library for interacting with Microsoft Word:
   ```bash
   pip install pywin32
   ```



#### Run
To start the Secret Notepad application:
```bash
python secret_notepad.py
```
Replace `secret_notepad.py` with the filename of your script. Enjoy your whimsical secret-keeping!
