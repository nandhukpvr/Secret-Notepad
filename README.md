### Project Description
This project is a "Secret Notepad" application built with Python's Tkinter library. It provides a secure notepad interface where users can type and save secret messages. The application features disappearing text, automatic character counting and a random text-based "encryption" that saves each secret message with unique paths.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt the overwhelming need to save secrets in a way that even you might not remember? Tired of traditional notepads that store secrets far too accessibly? Welcome to the realm of our "Secret Notepad," designed to store secrets in files you‚Äôll likely never locate again!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing a notepad that saves your secrets, and a self-erasing feature! This app not only hides your message but makes finding it feel like a treasure hunt. Forget traditional security ‚Äì this is the finest way to manage your secret messages.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used

### Implementation
For Software:

#### Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can check with:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. Install Tkinter (usually included with Python, but in case it's missing):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # for Linux
   ```
   On Windows, Tkinter should be available by default with Python.

3. Install the `python-docx` library to enable creating and editing `.docx` files:
   ```bash
   pip install python-docx
   ```

4. Install the `pywin32` library for interacting with Microsoft Word:
   ```bash
   pip install pywin32
   ```



#### Run
To start the Secret Notepad application:
```bash
python secret_notepad.py
```
Replace `secret_notepad.py` with the filename of your script. Enjoy your whimsical secret-keeping!
